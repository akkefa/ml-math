Calculus
=========
Calculus is a branch of mathematics that gives tools to study rate of change
of functions trough two main areas: derivatives and integrals

Derivatives
------------
The derivative of a function is related to its rate of change. The rate of change
tells you how much the output of the function changes when a change is done
to the input. It is calculated as the ratio between a change in the output and
the corresponding change in the input.
