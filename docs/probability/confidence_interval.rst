Confidence Interval

.. centered::
    A 95% confidence for the mean μ is given by (-2.14,3.07).


.. title:: This does NOT mean:
    - You are 95% “confident” that the true mean μ is between -2.14 and 3.07.
    - The true mean is between -2.14 and 3.07 with probability 0.95.

There's no probability, where does the probability come in?

it comes in from random sampling. The fact that if you select a random sample and compute your estimator and if you got
to do it again or if someone else did it, they're going to get a different estimator based on the :guilabel:`randomness of the sample`.

- Collect your sample.
- Estimate the parameter.
- Return a confidence interval.

If you did this again, you would not get the same results! Different samples and different confidence intervals.
