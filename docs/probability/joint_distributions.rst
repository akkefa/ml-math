Joint Distributions
====================

Discrete Definition
--------------------
Given two discrete random variables, X and Y , p(x, y) = P(X = x, Y = y) is the joint probability mass
function for X and Y .

**Important property** X and Y are independent random variables if P(X = x, Y = y) = P(X = x)P(Y = y) for all
possible values of x and y.

:math:`f(x,y) = P(X=x \, and \, Y=y) = P(X=x,Y=y)`

- Sum of all marginal probabilities is equal to 1. ( P(y=0) + P(y=100) = P(y = 200) = 1 )
- Sum of all joint probabilities is equal to 1.

Example
--------
An insurance agency services customers who have both a homeowner’s policy and an automobile policy. For each
type of policy, a deductible amount must be specified. For an automobile policy, the choices are $100 or $250 and for
the homeowner’s policy, the choices are $0, $100, or $200.

``Recall`` Two events are independent if P(A and B) = P(A)P(B) for all possible values of A and B.

| P(x=100,y=100) = .1
| P(x=100) p(y=200) = (.5)(.25) =.125

X and y are not independent.
