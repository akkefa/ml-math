# Hypothesis Testing

## What is Hypothesis Testing?
- Hypothesis testing is an act in statistics whereby an analyst tests an assumption regarding a population parameter.
- Hypothesis testing is a formal procedure for investigating our ideas about the world using statistics. It is most
  often used by scientists to test specific predictions, called hypotheses, that arise from theories.


### Steps

There are 5 main steps in hypothesis testing:

1. State your research hypothesis as a null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis (Ho) and (Ha or H1).
2. Collect data in a way designed to test the hypothesis.
3. Perform an appropriate statistical test.
4. Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis.
5. Present the findings in your results and discussion section.
