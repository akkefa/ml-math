```{title} What is hypothesis testing?
```

# Hypothesis Testing
Statistical inference is the process of learning about characteristics of a population based
on what is observed in a relatively small sample from that population. A sample will never give us the
entire picture though, and we are bound to make incorrect decisions from time to time. We
will learn how to derive and interpret appropriate tests to manage this error and how to
evaluate when one test is better than another. we
will learn how to construct and perform principled hypothesis tests for a wide range of
problems and applications when they are not.

## What is Hypothesis
- Hypothesis testing is an act in statistics whereby an analyst tests an assumption regarding a population parameter.
- Hypothesis testing is a formal procedure for investigating our ideas about the world using statistics. It is most
  often used by scientists to test specific predictions, called hypotheses, that arise from theories.

:::{note}
Due to random samples and randomness in the problem, we can different errors in our hypothesis testing. These errors are
  called Type I and Type II errors.

### Steps

There are 5 main steps in hypothesis testing:

1. State your research hypothesis as a null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis (Ho) and (Ha or H1).
2. Collect data in a way designed to test the hypothesis.
3. Perform an appropriate statistical test.
4. Decide whether to reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis.
5. Present the findings in your results and discussion section.

### Type of hypothesis testing
Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a [random sample](random-sample)  from the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$

```{code-cell}
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy.stats import norm


sns.set_theme(style="darkgrid")
sample = torch.normal(mean = 8, std = 16, size=(1,1000))

sns.displot(sample[0], kde=True, stat = 'density',)
plt.axvline(torch.mean(sample[0]), color='red', label='mean')

plt.show()
```
Example of random sample after it is observed:

$$
2.73,1.14,3.98,2.15,5,85,1.97,2.54,2.03
$$

Based on what you are seeing, do you believe that the true population mean $\mu$ is

$$

\begin{align}
\mu<=3 \\
or \\
\mu>3 \\
\text { The sample is } \overline{\mathrm{x}}=2.799
\end{align}

$$

This is below 3 , but can we say that $\mu<3$ ?

This seems awfully dependent on the random sample we happened to get!
Let's try to work with the most generic random sample of size 8:

$$
X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5, X_6, X_7, X_8
$$

The Sample mean is 

$$
\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=11}^n X_i
$$

- We're going to tend to think that $\mu<3$ when $\bar{X}$ is "significantly" smaller than 3.
- We're going to tend to think that $\mu>3$ when $\bar{X}$ is "significantly" larger than 3.
- We're never going to observe $\bar{X}=3$, but we may be able to be convinced that $\mu=3$ if $\bar{X}$ is not too far away.


**How do we formalize this stuff, We use hypothesis testing**

Hypotheses:

$\mathrm{H}_0: \mu \leq 3$ <- Null hypothesis \
$\mathrm{H}_1: \mu>3 \quad$ Alternate hypothesis

#### Null hypothesis
The null hypothesis is assumed to be true. 

#### Alternate hypothesis
The alternate hypothesis is what we are out to show.

Conclusion is either:
Reject $\mathrm{H}_0 \quad$ OR $\quad$ Fail to Reject $\mathrm{H}_0$


#### simple hypothesis
Do you know the exact distribution

#### composite hypothesis
You dont know the exact distribution.

Means you know the distribution is normal but you dont know the mean and variance.


#### Errors in Hypothesis Testing

You are a potato chip manufacturer and you want to ensure that the mean amount in 15 ounce bags is at least 15 ounces.
$\mathrm{H}_0: \mu \leq 15 \quad \mathrm{H}_1: \mu>15$

##### Type I Error
The true mean is $\leq 15$ but you concluded i was $>15$. You are going to save some money because you won't be adding
chips but you are risking a lawsuit!

##### Type II Error
The true mean is $> 15$ but you concluded it was $\leq 15$ . You are going to be spending money increasing the amount
of chips when you didnâ€™t have to.
