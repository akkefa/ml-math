    "A tree is a widely used abstract data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children represented as a set of linked nodes. It is a non-linear data structure compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues which are linear data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terminologies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node**: The fundamental part of a tree which contains data and links to other nodes.\n",
    "- **Root**: The top node in a tree.\n",
    "- **Edge**: The link between any two nodes.\n",
    "- **Child**: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.\n",
    "- **Parent**: The converse notion of a child.\n",
    "- **Leaf**: A node with no children.\n",
    "- **Subtree**: A tree formed by a node and its descendants.\n",
    "- **Depth**: The length of the path from the root to the node.\n",
    "- **Height**: The length of the path from the node to the deepest leaf.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.\n",
    "- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child only nodes with values greater than the parent node.\n",
    "- **Balanced Tree**: A tree where the height of the left and right subtree of any node differ by not more than one.\n",
    "- **AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, B-Tree**: Self-balancing binary search trees.\n",
