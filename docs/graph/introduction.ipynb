    "In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines).\n",

    "it is considered an abstract data type that is really good for representing connections or relations – unlike the tabular data structures of relational database systems, which are ironically very limited in expressing relations.\n",

    "## Graph Data Structure\n",
    "A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be defined as, a Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.\n",

    "In graph theory, a graph is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of objects, called vertices or nodes, and a set of connections, called edges, which link pairs of vertices.\n",
    "The notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "G = (V, E)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is used to represent a graph, where $G$ is the graph, $V$ is the set of vertices, and $\\bigvee$ is the set of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nodes of a graph can represent any objects, such as cities, people, web pages, or molecules, and the edges represent the relationships or connections between them."

    "## Graphs Terminology\n",
    "The following are the most commonly used terms in graph theory with respect to graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a \"node\", is a fundamental part of a graph. In the context of graphs, a vertex is an object which may contain zero or more items called attributes.\n",
    "2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two vertices. An edge may contain a weight/value/cost.\n",
    "3. Path - A path is a sequence of edges connecting a sequence of vertices.\n",
    "4. Cycle - A cycle is a path of edges that starts and ends on the same vertex.\n",
    "5. Weighted Graph/Network - A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.\n",
    "6. Unweighted Graph/Network - An unweighted graph is a graph in which all edges have equal weight.\n",
    "7. Directed Graph/Network - A directed graph is a graph where all the edges are directed.\n",
    "8. Undirected Graph/Network - An undirected graph is a graph where all the edges are not directed.\n",
    "9. Adjacent Vertices - Two vertices in a graph are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Graphs\n",
    "There are many types of graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Directed Graphs\n",
    "2. Undirected Graphs\n",
    "3. Weighted Graph\n",
    "4. Cyclic Graph\n",
    "5. Acyclic Graph\n",
    "6. Directed Acyclic Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs have many properties, including the direction of travel for each relationship. The decision of which graph type you use usually depends on the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may not be an explicit direction from one node to another, such as with friendships in a social network, but in others, there might be clearly defined directions, such as flights and airports dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directed Graphs\n",
    "In a directed graph, all the edges are directed. That means, each edge is associated with a direction. For example, if there is an edge from node A to node B, then the edge is directed from A to B and not the other way around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Directed graph, also called a digraph.\n",

    "### Weighted Graph\n",
    "In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a weight or a cost. The weight can be positive, negative or zero. The weight of an edge is represented by a number. A graph G= (V, E) is called a labeled or weighted graph because each edge has a value or weight representing the cost of traversing that edge.\n",

    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drawbacks of adjacency matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The adjacency matrix representation of a graph is not suitable for a graph with a large number of vertices. This is because the number of entries in the matrix is proportional to the square of the number of vertices in the graph.\n",
    "2. The adjacency matrix representation of a graph is not suitable for a graph with parallel edges. This is because the matrix can only store a single value for each pair of vertices.\n",
    "3. One of the main drawbacks of using an adjacency matrix is its space complexity: as the number of nodes in the graph grows, the space required to store the adjacency matrix increases exponentially. adjacency matrix has a space complexity of\n",
    "$O\\left(|V|^2\\right)_{\\text {, where }}|V|_{\\text{repre- }}$ sents the number of nodes in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the adjacency matrix is a useful data structure for representing small graphs, it may not be practical for larger ones due to its space complexity. Additionally, the overhead of adding or removing nodes can make it inefficient for dynamically changing graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge list\n",
    "An edge list is a list of all the edges in a graph. Each edge is represented by a tuple or a pair of vertices. The edge list can also include the weight or cost of each edge. This is the data structure we used to create our graphs with networkx:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "checking whether two vertices are connected in an edge list requires iterating through the entire list, which can be time-consuming for large graphs with many edges. Therefore, edge lists are more commonly used in applications where space is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjacency List\n",
    "In an adjacency list, each vertex stores a list of adjacent vertices. The following figure shows an adjacency list for a graph with 4 vertices.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, checking whether two vertices are connected can be slower than with an adjacency matrix. This is because it requires iterating through the adjacency list of one of the vertices, which can be time-consuming for large graphs.\n",

    "## Graph Traversals\n",

    "DFS is a recursive algorithm that starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "It chooses a node and explores all of its unvisited neighbors, visiting the first neighbor that has not been explored and backtracking only when all the neighbors have been visited.

    "Graph algorithms are used to solve problems that involve graphs. Graph algorithms are used to find the shortest path between two nodes, find the minimum spanning tree, find the strongly connected components, find the shortest path from a single node to all other nodes, find the bridges and articulation points, find the Eulerian path and circuit, find the maximum flow, find the maximum matching, find the biconnected components, find the Hamiltonian path and circuit, find the dominating set, find the shortest path from a single node to all other nodes, find the bridges and articulation points, find the Eulerian path and circuit, find the maximum flow, find the maximum matching, find the biconnected components, find the Hamiltonian path and circuit, find the dominating set, etc."
