The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

    "## Graphs Terminology\n",
    "The following are the most commonly used terms in graph theory with respect to graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a \"node\", is a fundamental part of a graph. In the context of graphs, a vertex is an object which may contain zero or more items called attributes.\n",
    "2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two vertices. An edge may contain a weight/value/cost.\n",
    "3. Path - A path is a sequence of edges connecting a sequence of vertices.\n",
    "4. Cycle - A cycle is a path of edges that starts and ends on the same vertex.\n",
    "5. Weighted Graph/Network - A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.\n",
    "6. Unweighted Graph/Network - An unweighted graph is a graph in which all edges have equal weight.\n",
    "7. Directed Graph/Network - A directed graph is a graph where all the edges are directed.\n",
    "8. Undirected Graph/Network - An undirected graph is a graph where all the edges are not directed.\n",
    "9. Adjacent Vertices - Two vertices in a graph are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them.\n",

    "#### Calculating the degree of node in adjacency matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum all the 1 in the row corresponding to the node. The sum of the elements in the row corresponding to the node is the degree of the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} https://github.com/akkefa/ml-notes/releases/download/v0.1.0/adjacency_matrix.jpg\n",
    ":alt: adjacency matrix\n",
    ":width: 60%\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drawbacks of adjacency matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The adjacency matrix representation of a graph is not suitable for a graph with a large number of vertices. This is because the number of entries in the matrix is proportional to the square of the number of vertices in the graph.\n",
    "2. The adjacency matrix representation of a graph is not suitable for a graph with parallel edges. This is because the matrix can only store a single value for each pair of vertices.\n",
    "3. One of the main drawbacks of using an adjacency matrix is its space complexity: as the number of nodes in the graph grows, the space required to store the adjacency matrix increases exponentially. adjacency matrix has a space complexity of\n",
    "$O\\left(|V|^2\\right)_{\\text {, where }}|V|_{\\text{repre- }}$ sents the number of nodes in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the adjacency matrix is a useful data structure for representing small graphs, it may not be practical for larger ones due to its space complexity. Additionally, the overhead of adding or removing nodes can make it inefficient for dynamically changing graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge list\n",
    "An edge list is a list of all the edges in a graph. Each edge is represented by a tuple or a pair of vertices. The edge list can also include the weight or cost of each edge. This is the data structure we used to create our graphs with networkx:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "checking whether two vertices are connected in an edge list requires iterating through the entire list, which can be time-consuming for large graphs with many edges. Therefore, edge lists are more commonly used in applications where space is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjacency List\n",
    "In an adjacency list, each vertex stores a list of adjacent vertices. The following figure shows an adjacency list for a graph with 4 vertices.\n",

    "```{image} https://notes.shichao.io/clrs/figure_22.1.png\n",
    ":alt: adjacency list\n",
    ":width: 60%\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, checking whether two vertices are connected can be slower than with an adjacency matrix. This is because it requires iterating through the adjacency list of one of the vertices, which can be time-consuming for large graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Traversals\n",
    "Traversal means to walk along the edges of a graph in specific ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph algorithms are critical in solving problems related to graphs, such as finding the shortest path between two nodes or detecting cycles. This section will discuss two graph traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph traversal is the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph, exactly once. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the vertices are visited. The order may be defined by a specific rule, for example, depth-first search and breadth-first search.\n",

    "We know that depth-first search is the process of traversing down through one branch of a tree until we get to a leaf, and then working our way back to the “trunk” of the tree. In other words, implementing a DFS means traversing down through the subtrees of a binary search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS is a recursive algorithm that starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "It chooses a node and explores all of its unvisited neighbors, visiting the first neighbor that has not been explored and backtracking only when all the neighbors have been visited. By doing so, it explores the graph by following as deep a path from the starting node as possible before backtracking to explore other branches. This continues until all nodes have been explored.\n",
