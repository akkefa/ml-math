# Graphs Data Structure

## Binary Search Tree
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree in which the left child of a node has a value less than the node’s value and the right child has a value greater than the node’s value. This property is called the BST property and it makes it possible to efficiently search, insert, and delete elements in the tree.

### Height of BST
The height of a Binary Tree is defined as the maximum depth of any leaf node from the root node. That is, it is the length of the longest path from the root node to any leaf node.
